# SVM-Kernel-performance-comparison

This project is a direct comprison of popular SVM kernels attempting to predict penguins into three subspecies based on measurements of the beak.

The notebook was written in Google Colab and can be opened and edited. It can also be opened with PyCharm Pro or any other notebook editor.

The report written by me explains the problem domain and the research that went into this project.

This project was a part of my university degree in Computer Science at the University of Greenwich.

This project is also avaliable on Kaggle:
